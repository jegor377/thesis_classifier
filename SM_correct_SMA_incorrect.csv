While the issue has received limited public attention, the implications for Georgia's social and economic landscape are significant.  This decline in income represents a loss of financial security for countless families, who now face a greater burden of living expenses, and potentially hinder their prospects for homeownership, college education for children, and overall financial stability.  This decline in middle class income in Georgia should serve as a call to action. It is imperative for lawmakers, policymakers, and institutions to prioritize solutions that address the root causes of this economic downturn.  This could include incentivizing businesses to create more high-paying jobs, expanding access to affordable housing, and providing resources for job training and retraining initiatives.
